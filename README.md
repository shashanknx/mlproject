# Exploring Regression Techniques in Machine Learning

## Setup

1. **Required Libraries**: Install Required Python 3 and required Python libraries

  - seaborn

  - matplotlib

  - pandas

  - numpy

  - scipy

  - scikit-learn

2. **Run the file**:

  - Navigate to the project directory in terminal (or equivalent on windows)

  - Run Command; `python3 main.py`

_Note:_ Running the code will output all the key values referenced in _report.pdf_ into the console. Sometimes some of the values will be slightly different due to variability of the algorithms.

## Description

Using the [Ames Housing Dataset][1] from Kaggle, implement machine learning techniques to determine relationships between home price and 79 measured explanatory variables. I focussed on evaluating three different regression techniques: Kernel Ridge, K-Neighbors, and a Neural Network.

Read the _report.pdf_ for a detailed description of the project.
